# MChat â€“ Conversational AI Chatbot

## Overview
MChat is a professional-grade conversational AI chatbot designed to simulate intelligent dialogue using modern natural language processing techniques. Itâ€™s intended for use in customer service, learning assistants, or AI showcases.

## Problem Statement
Many chatbots rely on rigid rule-based systems or shallow responses. MChat aims to create a more natural and responsive conversational flow using advanced sequence models.

## Solution
MChat uses a combination of RNN and Transformer-based architectures to generate context-aware responses. It supports memory within a session, dynamic personality, and integration with external APIs or knowledge bases.

## Technologies Used
- Python (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
- RNNs or Transformer (GPT-style or BERT encoder-decoder)
- Streamlit for web interface
- Custom retrieval logic for FAQ/knowledge base (optional)

## Key Features
- Context-aware response generation
- Live chat interface with user-friendly UI
- Modular backend: can integrate with CV, FAQ, project info
- Personality customization (tone, style)

## Results / Outcomes
- Demonstrated use in professional assistant scenarios
- Scalable: can plug in any domain knowledge or business logic

## Future Improvements
- Add voice interaction
- Connect to live databases or APIs for real-time updates
